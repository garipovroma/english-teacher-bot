Comparison of Present Continuous and Present Simple 1 (Usage differences and contexts),"📚 Theory Card: Comparison of Present Continuous and Present Simple 1 (Usage differences and contexts) 📚

Theory:

The Present Continuous and Present Simple tenses are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences in usage and context. Here are the key differences:

🔹 Present Continuous (PC): Used to describe an action that is in progress at the moment of speaking, and has a temporary or changing nature.

🔹 Present Simple (PS): Used to describe an action that is happening repeatedly, generally, or as a habit.

Here are some examples to illustrate the differences:

🔹 PC:

* I am studying for my exam right now. (temporary action)
* She is working on her project this week. (changing nature)
* They are rehearsing for their play every day. (in progress)

🔹 PS:

* I go to the gym three times a week. (habit)
* She likes to read books in her free time. (generally)
* They have a meeting every morning at 9 am. (repeated action)

In summary, the Present Continuous is used for temporary or changing actions, while the Present Simple is used for habitual or general actions.

📚 Examples:

* I am studying for my exam right now (PC)
* I go to the gym three times a week (PS)
* She is working on her project this week (PC)
* She likes to read books in her free time (PS)
* They are rehearsing for their play every day (PC)
* They have a meeting every morning at 9 am (PS)"

Theory:

The Present Continuous and Present Simple tenses are both used to describe actions that are happening now, but they have some differences in their usage and meaning.

🔹 Present Continuous:

* Used to describe an action that is in progress at the moment of speaking.

Comparing Present Perfect Continuous and Simple (Usage and differences),"📚 Theory Card: Comparing Present Perfect Continuous and Simple (Usage and differences) 📚

Theory:

🔹 The Present Perfect Continuous (PPC) and the Simple Present (SP) are both used to talk about actions that started in the past and continue up to the present moment.

🔹 However, there are some key differences between the two tenses:

🔺 PPC emphasizes the duration and completion of an action, while SP emphasizes the fact that an action started and continues up to the present.

🔺 PPC is used to talk about actions that have a specific time frame, while SP is used to talk about actions that started in the past and continue indefinitely.

🔺 PPC is more formal than SP and is often used in formal writing and speaking.

Examples:

📝 PPC: I have been studying English for three years now, and I can finally hold a conversation in the language. (emphasizes the duration and completion of the action)

📝 SP: I have been studying English for three years, and I can finally hold a conversation in the language. (emphasizes the fact that the action started and continues indefinitely)

📝 PPC: She has been working at the company for five months, and she is still learning new things. (emphasizes the duration and completion of the action)

📝 SP: She has been working at the company for five months, and she is still learning new things. (emphasizes the fact that the action started and continues indefinitely)

🔹 In summary, PPC is used to talk about completed actions with a specific time frame, while SP is used to talk about actions that started in the past and continue indefinitely. Both tenses are important and can be used in different contexts to convey different meanings."

Basic Passive Constructions (is done / was done),"📚 Theory Card: Basic Passive Constructions (is done / was done) 📝

Theory:

Advanced Passive Constructions (be done / been done / being done),"📚 Theory Card: Advanced Passive Constructions (be done / been done / being done) 🔍

Theory:

* Advanced passive constructions involve using the passive voice to express complex actions or states that have been completed, are ongoing, or have been happening continuously.
* The passive voice is used to focus on the action or state, rather than the person or thing performing the action.
* There are three main types of advanced passive constructions:
	+ Be done: The action or state is completed and has a specific time reference.
	+ Been done: The action or state is completed and has no specific time reference.
	+ Being done: The action or state is ongoing and has no specific time reference.

Examples:

🔎 Be done:

* The project has been done by the team. (specific time reference)
* The research has been completed. (specific time reference)

🔎 Been done:

* The company has been sold. (no specific time reference)
* The city has been renovated. (no specific time reference)

🔎 Being done:

* The meeting is being done online. (ongoing and no specific time reference)
* The project is being worked on. (ongoing and no specific time reference)

Remember, the passive voice can be used to create more formal or impersonal writing, and it can also be used to emphasize the action or state rather than the person or thing performing it."
Varieties of Passive (Multiple forms and uses),"📚 Theory Card: Varieties of Passive (Multiple forms and uses) 📚

Theory:

🔹 Passive voice is a grammatical construction in which the subject of the sentence is acted upon by the verb, rather than performing the action described by the verb.

🔹 There are several forms of passive voice, including:

🔺 Simple passive: The subject is acted upon by the verb, and the verb is in the passive form (e.g. ""The ball was thrown by John"").

🔻 Transitive passive: The subject is acted upon by the verb, and the verb is in the passive form (e.g. ""The ball was thrown"").

🔼 Intransitive passive: The subject is acted upon by the verb, and the verb is in the passive form (e.g. ""The ball was thrown"").

🔽 Phrasal passive: A combination of a verb and a preposition or an adverb that creates a passive meaning (e.g. ""The ball was kicked out of the field"").

Examples:

🔹 Simple passive:

* The ball was thrown by John.
* The book was written by Jane.

🔻 Transitive passive:

* The ball was thrown.
* The ball was kicked.

🔼 Intransitive passive:

* The ball was thrown.
* The ball was kicked.

🔽 Phrasal passive:

* The ball was kicked out of the field.
* The ball was thrown away.

"Expressions with ""it is said that"", ""he is supposed to"" (Impersonal passive structures)","Theory Card: Impersonal Passive Structures with ""it is said that"" and ""he is supposed to""

Theory:
Impersonal passive structures are used to describe a situation or event without specifying who is performing the action. These structures are formed using ""it is said that"" or ""he is supposed to"" followed by a verb in the passive voice.

Examples:

🔵 It is said that the new policy will be implemented next month. (The action is the implementation of the policy, but it is not specified who will perform the action.)

🔵 He is supposed to finish the project by the end of the week. (The action is the finishing of the project, but it is not specified who will perform the action.)

🔵 It is said that the company will launch a new product next year. (The action is the launching of the product, but it is not specified who will perform the action.)
